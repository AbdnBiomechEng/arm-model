## Contributor Guidelines

We encourage all members of Aberdeen Biomechanical and Biomedical Engineering to contribute to this team project. You will need a Github account to do this.

There are many different ways to contribute to this research project: fixing code, improving the model, adding features, helping with documentation. In all cases you should adopt the following workflow to ensure your changes are useful and in sync with the rest of the team.

### Add an issue describing your suggested contribution

Once you've identified a way to contribute, please let us know what you're planning to do by adding a new issue, or assign an [existing issue](https://github.com/AbdnBiomechEng/arm-model/issues) to yourself. Issues are basically tasks that we want to achieve, so by adding your issue to the list we can keep track of who is working on what.

*Please don't skip this step, as knowing what you're planning on doing in advance ensures you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.* Here is [more information about Github issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues).

### Create a new branch

Give your branch a *meaningful name* so that it is clear that it addresses the issue. Using a separate [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) allows you to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.

### Create a draft pull request 

and add "closes #[issue number]" in the description. A [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) is the method by which you let us know of the contribution you have made. 

Adding "closes #[issue number]" in the description [links the pull request to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword). This shows that work is in progress to address the issue, and it automatically closes the issue when the pull request is merged.

### Make your changes in the new branch

Make sure you commit your changes frequently, and use good commit messages that briefly describe the changes you made.

### Change the draft pull request to "ready for review"

When you are ready to get feedback from other team members, [change the draft pull request to ready to review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#marking-a-pull-request-as-ready-for-review). You can ask specific team members to [review your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). 

### Merge the pull request.

When you get approval from the reviewer, merge the pull request and delete the branch (this closes the issue).

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley:
